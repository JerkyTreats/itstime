## Description of Product 

A dead simple mobile app that's literally just push notifications. 

Then build some schedulizer backend. Just throw it in the tailscale network for now. 

I think we'll probably want to have a register/ endpoint, so the API Mesh can send it commands. Geez I wonder if it really is time to consider gRPC contract standards- protobufs? 

But obviously it will have a bunch of self defined scheduled reminders to ping about. So mesh integration can be for later.
